## TypeDB Studio

[![TypeDB Studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567679/170486678-8f226139-4163-4356-8567-082abf8487cc.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567679/170486678-8f226139-4163-4356-8567-082abf8487cc.png)

TypeDB Studio is TypeDB's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering.

You can utilise Studio like [TypeDB Console](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/running-typedb/console)
and [TypeDB Clients](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview), to connect to your TypeDB instance and perform
queries.

Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created TypeDB database, or you prefer a graphical
interface for reading data from TypeDB, you will find Studio extremely useful.

## Alpha Releases

At this time, alpha releases allow you to visualise and explore your data!

Styling, layouts, installation, etc. are all subject to change.

## Usage

Usage is easy! After you install the appropriate distribution, just enter the address and name of your database and
start writing queries.

### Reasoning and Explanations

TypeDB Studio currently always enables inference, and highlights the concepts which are inferred when visualising
answers to your query.

Double click the inferred concepts to retrieve their explanations and visualise how the fact was inferred.

## Download TypeDB Studio
